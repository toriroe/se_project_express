# SE Project Express

This project focused on creating the first stages of a back end for the previous sprint's project: "WTWR: What to Wear" React app. It's a server that is responsible for handling HTTP requests that interact with a database in order to add, read, delete, like, and unlike clothing items, as well as add and read users.

## Technologies Used

This is a Node.js app using Express.js framework. This framework was used to create the server, routes, and handle HTTP requests.
Mongoose was used to interact with a MongoDB database to manage data. Validator.js is used to validate the avatar and imageUrl fields in the user and clothing item schemas respectively, ensuring that the URLs given for each are valid.

## Plans to improve project

Will connect the back end to front-end WTWR React app so that users can interact with the app to add, remove, and like clothing items that will be saved in a database. Plan to implement user authorization in future sprints.
